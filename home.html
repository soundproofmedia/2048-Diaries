    <h2>Resurrection</h2>
    <p>Thirty years ago, bringing an artist back to life was more of a parody than a resurrection, with holograms, impressionists and warping of old material to create a phantom. A reflection of life, not a recreation. <br>
    Today I have the late Freddie Mercury recording his new album, <i>Resurrection</i>. My agent tells me the technology inside “Freddie” cost more than the past 50 years of space travel combined. I was surprised to find out they would be using my studio, and they told me to prepare to record “Freddie’s” vocals. I was sceptical but nevertheless, I set up my microphone and set it to replicate his old C414 and waited. <br>
    Even though I interact with Biotech on a daily basis, checking in to a hotel or walking the neighbour's dog, a part of me still expected a big machine to be wheeled in, accompanied by a bespeckled programmer frantically smashing keys to fire up the engines. I’m probably showing my age as we’re leaps ahead of those weird, jittery animatronics they used to have at Disneyland, but I still find myself taking new technologies with a pinch of salt. <br>
    Most customer service roles these days are Biotech, they can work longer hours, they don’t need to be paid, they don’t take breaks and they always smile. Of course, some fancy hotels and restaurants still have human workers but not many people can afford to go there, and these restaurants are generally one of the few places you can still eat animal meat - I can’t remember how long it’s been since I’ve had a real steak. I don’t think there’s a great deal of difference with the synthetic meats, “lab-grown steak” as the tabloids pitched it. Once everyone got over that initial stigma, they realised it was exactly the same thing that tasted the same, and is identical in every way except it didn't come from an animal. 
    <br><br>
    A knock at the door woke me from my food daydream and brought me back to reality. They were here. I opened the door to my agent who introduced me to  “Freddie’s” manager - Art. After showing them around the studio Art turned to me and said. “This looks perfect, I’ll go get Freddie from the car.” <br>
    A minute or two later he returned and following him was not the bespeckled IT guy I’d imagined, or a team of people wheeling in a futuristic coffin. As silly as it sounds, what followed him was the last thing I ever expected to see. Freddie Mercury stood right in front of my nose, no sunglasses or lycra, just dressed in casual clothes, not too dissimilar to my own, but he was Freddie alright. He put out his hand and shook mine looking into my eyes and thanking me. His hand was warm to the touch and I could see the pores in his skin. <br>
    My mouth was not functioning. Words escaped me. All I could do was grin and wave him through the door and lead him to the vocal booth… whilst every so often making involuntary noises somewhere between a shy school girl giggle and a pining dog. <br>
    I composed myself back in the control room and looking at the Digi-glass I could see he was ready to go. I cued up the first track, he took a deep breath and then.....the air particles on planet earth were once again vibrating from the voice of Freddie Mercury.

    <h2>Live on Mars</h2>
    <p>Living on Mars has its perks. The food is great, the views are incredible and although our whole civilization is confined to a glass bubble it doesn’t feel like we are living in a fishbowl. I have lived here for the past 14 months. I came partly for work but mostly for a different life to my parents. My dad shared with me the magic of Sci-Fi and, like him, I dreamt of one day heading out to the stars in search for a new planet to settle down on. So of course when presented with the opportunity, I had to go. For Dad but also because...it’s Mars. <br>
    The population is around 7,600, with most of them living in the main bubble. There are various government buildings, space-docks and the EVA port connected to the main bubble by tubes. So from above, it looks something like a spider. The first settlers came five years ago, and in the past 3 years the population has grown massively. The main bubble is split into districts, each of them named after one of the first settlers. The biggest of these - the Entertainment district, or Froyd, takes up nearly half of the main bubble. There are shops, restaurants, cinemas and pretty much anything you could want. <br>
    As I strolled down the metallic walkways of Froyd in the early evening, looking for something to do, I stumbled across a new addition. Just down from Louis’ Diner, my favourite place for breakfast, I saw a black booth with only a door, above it we’re the words, <i>“Detrantha, the greatest composer in the universe, Live in concert.”</i> Detrantha is considered to be the best composer of our time. A few years ago back, on Earth, I went to a concert where I heard the most magical piano concerto. The speed and control displayed were not considered humanly possible before then, and in truth, it wasn’t. I’d heard this groundbreaking composer was a piano combined with Artificial intelligence that had been trained by learning from all the great composers. They could read so much more than just pitch and timing from the scores. Apparently the machine could understand emotional gesture, and it started to replicate the character of these composers. Before this, AI had major issues replicating human emotions in performance. Who’d have thought that music would eventually teach machines the mystery of human emotion? <br>
    The booth appeared to be offering the same concert I had attended, but I had been feeling homesick so decided to see what it was like. I stepped into the booth, sat down and a soothing voice instructed me to close my eyes and count to ten. Upon opening my eyes I found myself in the Royal Albert Hall, it was as if I was actually there, I was sat near the front. Prime spot. The lights went down and the curtains opened revealing a piano. <br>Immediately the air was filled with cascading notes. White and black keys colliding in mid-air and flying around my head.

    <h2>New Underground</h2>
    <p><i>Cyborgestra</i> are one of the most followed bands in the ECHOVRS right now. They have sold out every show and the stories get more outrageous every time. Tonight I am going to their biggest show yet, The Android Ballroom. If you’re a Cyberpunk and you weren’t born yesterday, then tonight you were going.
    The gig is in the ECHOVRS, <i>Verse</i> for short, so I can stay in bed but I still have plenty of preparations to make. I used to love getting all dressed up and going out to real venues, but as more and more places got shut down to make way for server blocks, before long, there wasn’t an underground scene anymore.
    Until they launched Verse. Suddenly we had a place to go. Somewhere we could let our hair down and be whoever we wanted to be. At first, most people couldn’t afford their own headset, so we would hit up the arcades. When you walk in, it looks like the old-school arcades in the eighties in nearly every way. They even play explicitly 80’s arcade hits. But all the machines are the same tall ominous black booths. Inside each one, a seat with a glowing halo floats above where your head would be. I spent every night in that arcade. I had my favourite spot right at the back, no-one could see me from the entrance so I wasn't often disturbed or found by my younger sister. Just how I liked it. 
    As soon as you sit down, the halo moves down so it hovers just above your head, then a calm voice instructs you to close your eyes and count to 10. 
    It’s like you’re falling asleep, but your mind isn’t. Your body goes limp and all your muscles relax. Just as you finish counting and reach one, your vision returns and you’re in the ECHOVRS lobby. This is where everyone comes through, it’s like Grand Central station, from here you can go anywhere in the Verse. 
    These days most people have their own headset so the arcades aren’t half as busy anymore so that’s perfect for me. Personally, I still love coming to the arcade. The music is awesome, there’s a great atmosphere and I’ve come to know the guys at the pizza place next door extremely well. But tonight I don’t have to because I finally saved enough money to get my own headset. So I can stay right here. I’ve had it 4 days and I am pretty sure I have spent more time in the Verse than in real life but I have been waiting for tonight for months.
    I arrive in the lobby and head for the transport dock, even though I know where I’m going...it was obvious where to go. Ahead was a sea of people who, like me, donned leather jackets and fluorescent hair do’s. Some people had chosen to be more old school and traditional punk and others had gone all out. There were Avatars with robotic arms or legs, half a face melted off a beautiful girl to reveal a Cyborg underneath and just straight up robot people. I had kept things pretty normal for me, I love the idea of robotic arms but they are pretty much just for show and not particularly practical. Also, as I can’t really afford to buy a skin I had to build my own. So I have a torn up red and black leather jacket modelled on the one worn by Michael Jackson in the Thriller video. Cyberpunk’s come in all shapes and sizes but one thing that holds us all together is a love and passion for music, made by real human beings for humans.
